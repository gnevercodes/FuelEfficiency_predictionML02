# ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation Report â€“ Fuel Efficiency Prediction

## âœ… Metrics Used:
- **RÂ² Score:** Measures how well the model explains variance in the target variable.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Indicates average error between predicted and actual MPG.

## ðŸ“Š Results:

| Model                | RÂ² Score | RMSE |
|---------------------|----------|------|
| Linear Regression   | 0.78     | 3.1  |
| Random Forest       | 0.89     | 2.1  |

> ðŸ”Ž Note: Random Forest Regressor outperformed the baseline Linear Regression model in both RÂ² and RMSE, making it the recommended model for deployment.

## ðŸ“Œ Observations:
- Features like `horsepower`, `weight`, and `cylinders` had high correlation with MPG.
- Normalizing the features before modeling improved convergence and performance.
