# 🛠️ Fuel Efficiency Prediction using Machine Learning. 

This project uses machine learning to predict vehicle fuel efficiency based on various attributes such as horsepower, weight, displacement, and number of cylinders.

> 📌 Project 2 of 6 | Pushed as part of my academic + real-world ML portfolio 🚀

## 📁 Project Structure

- `ULTIMATE.ipynb`: Main notebook with EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.This ipynb exists in the code folder.

## 📊 Tools & Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset Used
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on [Kaggle: MPG Raw Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fseafp1/mpg-raw).  
It contains attributes like cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year to help predict vehicle fuel efficiency (MPG).

## 📌 Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Correlation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor
- Model Evaluation using RMSE & R² Score

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `ULTIMATE.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
3. Run all cells (preferably in a virtual environment)

## 📈 Output
Accurately predicts miles-per-gallon (MPG) and visualizes performance metrics.
